        The most iconic yet simplest dessert in all of Skyrim is the Sweetroll. 
        This treat earns its fame from a dialogue line said constantly by Skyrim's 
        guards expressing their annoyance. Time and time again, players have heard 
        the famous line, "Let me guess...someone stole your Sweetroll?". While this 
        line is said sarcastically, it is not surprising to think someone would steal 
        this delectable dessert. In Skyrim, it is easy to make; however, the real-life 
        recipe is a bit more demanding.

        Note: This recipe calls for real vanilla for a taste that will send you to 
        Sovengarde, but if you don’t have that on hand, 1 tsp vanilla extract is fine 
        too. The icing is also quite a conservative amount- just enough to glaze the top. 
        If you want a dripping sweetroll experience, you can double the amount.

    <p><em>You will need:</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large bundt tin (or 2 smaller ones)</li>
        <li>2 cups plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup caster sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup maple syrup or honey</li>
        <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>60g butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 vanilla pod, scraped</li>
        <li>3 tsp cinnamon powder</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>For glaze:</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup melted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup icing sugar</li>
        <li>1 vanilla pod, scraped</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <em>Method:</em>
        <br><br>
        Preheat oven to 200C/392F and grease your bundt tin well with butter.
        <br><br>
        In a large mixing bowl, combine all the baking ingredients and mix well. Pour into 
        the bundt tin/s and bake for 45 minutes, or until brown and risen. It should be firm 
        and crusty on the outside. Flip onto a wire rack to cool before transferring to a plate.
        <br><br>
        For the glaze, combine the melted butter, sugar, and vanilla in a small bowl and whip until 
        well blended. Drizzle over the top of your sweetroll and wait til icing has hardened before 
        eating.
