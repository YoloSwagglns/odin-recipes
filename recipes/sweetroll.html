        The most iconic yet simplest dessert in all of Skyrim is the Sweetroll.<br> 
        This treat earns its fame from a dialogue line said constantly by Skyrim's<br> 
        guards expressing their annoyance. Time and time again, players have heard<br> 
        the famous line, "Let me guess...someone stole your Sweetroll?". While this<br> 
        line is said sarcastically, it is not surprising to think someone would steal<br> 
        this delectable dessert. In Skyrim, it is easy to make; however, the real-life<br> 
        recipe is a bit more demanding.

    <p>
        Note: This recipe calls for real vanilla for a taste that will send you to<br> 
        Sovengarde, but if you don’t have that on hand, 1 tsp vanilla extract is fine<br> 
        too. The icing is also quite a conservative amount- just enough to glaze the top.<br> 
        If you want a dripping sweetroll experience, you can double the amount.
    </p>
    <p><em>You will need:</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large bundt tin (or 2 smaller ones)</li>
        <li>2 cups plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup caster sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup maple syrup or honey</li>
        <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>60g butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 vanilla pod, scraped</li>
        <li>3 tsp cinnamon powder</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>For glaze:</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup melted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup icing sugar</li>
        <li>1 vanilla pod, scraped</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Method:</em>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 200C/392F and grease your bundt tin well with butter.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine all the baking ingredients and mix well. Pour into<br> 
            the bundt tin/s and bake for 45 minutes, or until brown and risen. It should be firm<br>
            and crusty on the outside. Flip onto a wire rack to cool before transferring to a plate.</li>
        <li>For the glaze, combine the melted butter, sugar, and vanilla in a small bowl and whip until<br> 
            well blended. Drizzle over the top of your sweetroll and wait til icing has hardened before<br> 
            eating.</li>
    </ol>
