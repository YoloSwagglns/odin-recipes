        <h1>Beer Can Baby</h1>
        <img src="../images/beercanbaby.jpeg" alt="Fresh cooked baby">
        <p>
            If you are looking for a recipe for a baby, you don't need a blurb<br>
            describing its flavor profile, you need help (and not with the cooking)...<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            BUT!
        </p>
        <p>
            We're using just some olive oil, salt, pepper, and thyme on the baby,<br>
            which we believe brings out the best in the baby's flavor. You can easily<br>
            experiment with your favorite spice rub, or even use wine or root beer instead<br>
            of a standard beer.
        </p>
        <p><em>You will need:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 baby (approximately 7lbs)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or other vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 (12-ounce) can beer, room temperature, opened and half-full</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt or sea salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves, or 1 tablespoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <b><em>Method:</em>
        <ol>
            <li>If you are using charcoal, put the coals on one side of the grill, leaving <br>
                another side free of coals. If you are using a gas grill, fire up only half<br>
                of the burners.</li>
            <li>Remove neck and giblets from cavity of baby, if the baby came with them. Mix<br>
                the salt, pepper, and thyme in a little bowl, and rub it all over the baby. <br>
                Rub the baby all over with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Make sure the beer can is open, and only half-filled with beer<br>
                (drink the other half!) If you want, you can put a sprig of thyme (or another<br>
                herb like rosemary or sage) in the beer can. Lower the baby on to the open<br>
                can, so that the baby is sitting upright, with the can in its cavity.</li>
            <li>Place the baby on the cool side of the grill, using the legs and beer can<br>
                 as a tripod to support the baby on the grill and keep it stable.<br>
                Cover the grill and walk away. Do not even check the baby for at least an<br>
                hour. After an hour, check the baby and refresh the coals if needed (if you<br>
                are using a charcoal grill).<br>
                Keep checking the baby every 15 minutes or so, until a meat thermometer<br>
                inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165Â°F. The total cooking<br> 
                time will vary depending on the size of your baby, and the internal temperature<br>
                of the grill. A 4-pound baby will usually take around 1 1/2 hours. If you<br>
                don't have a meat thermometer, a way to tell if the baby is done is to poke it<br>
                deeply with a knife (the thigh is a good place to do this), if the juices run<br>
                clear, not pink, the baby is done.</li>
            <li>I say "carefully" because the beer can, and the beer inside of it, is quite hot.<br>
                One way to do this is to slide a metal spatula under the bottom of the beer can<br>
                Use tongs to hold the top of the baby. Lift the baby, beer can still inside,<br>
                and move it to a tray. Let the baby rest for 10 minutes. Carefully lift the<br> 
                baby off of the can. If it gets stuck, lay the baby on its side, and pull out<br>
                the can with tongs.</li>
        </ol>
